# OM20STD-LaTeX
The OpenMath 2.0 Standard Text in LaTeX form. 

This ia a very experimental LaTeX version of the OpenMath standard. The motivation is that
it is much easier to edit, and we can produce HTML via LaTeXML (see omstd20.html). Maybe
we can use this for further development of the standard.
